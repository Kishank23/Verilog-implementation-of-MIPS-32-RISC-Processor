# Verilog-implementation-of-MIPS-32-RISC-Processor
– Verilog behavioral codes were developed for the pipelined design and implementation of a subset of the MIPS-32
instruction set, covering various addressing modes and adhering to the principles of RISC design philosophy.
– The processor utilizes a pipelined architecture with five stages for executing instructions which comprise of Instruction
Fetch (IF), Instruction Decode (ID), Execute (EX), Memory Access (MEM), and Write-Back (WB).
